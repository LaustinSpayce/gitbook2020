# Relational Tables in SQL - Many to Many

## Many-to-many with join tables
The only way to store the data needed in a many-to-many relationship is to add a **join table**. These tables allow records to be created that reference both tables at once. They are really meant to only hold foreign keys.



### Joins
The join statement fuses the results of queries in two tables together.

If it seems like the information is incomplete, we can add more join clauses to get a complete dataset, but in practice this will mostly be done in the javascript/ruby side.

There are four kinds of joins, but for join tables we will only be using inner joins.

```
SELECT table1.column1,table1.column2,table2.column1,....
FROM table1
INNER JOIN table2
ON table1.matching_column = table2.matching_column;


table1: First table.
table2: Second table
matching_column: Column common to both the tables.
```

```
SELECT owners.name, dogs.name
FROM dogs
INNER JOIN owners
ON (owners.id = dogs.owner_id);
```

```
SELECT owners.name, dogs.name
FROM dogs
INNER JOIN owners
ON (owners.id = dogs.owner_id)
WHERE owner.id = 1;
```


### Many-to-many: Shops and Products
A shop has many products and products can be in many stores.

tables.sql:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS shops (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS shop_products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER,
    shop_id INTEGER
);
```


Create Shops
```
INSERT INTO shops (name) VALUES ('Alex''s Boutique');
INSERT INTO shops (name) VALUES ('Nick''s Bargains');
INSERT INTO shops (name) VALUES ('Worst Buy');
```


Create Products
```
INSERT INTO products (name) VALUES ('Baby Powder');
INSERT INTO products (name) VALUES ('Boxing Gloves');
INSERT INTO products (name) VALUES ('Hulk iPhone Case');
INSERT INTO products (name) VALUES ('Oversize Novelty Toothbrush');
```


Fill join table
```
INSERT INTO shop_products (product_id, shop_id) VALUES (1,2);
INSERT INTO shop_products (product_id, shop_id) VALUES (1,3);
INSERT INTO shop_products (product_id, shop_id) VALUES (2,3);
INSERT INTO shop_products (product_id, shop_id) VALUES (2,1);
INSERT INTO shop_products (product_id, shop_id) VALUES (3,3);
INSERT INTO shop_products (product_id, shop_id) VALUES (4,3);
INSERT INTO shop_products (product_id, shop_id) VALUES (4,2);
INSERT INTO shop_products (product_id, shop_id) VALUES (4,1);
```


| id  | name            |
| --- | ---             |
| 1   | Alex's Boutique |
| 2   | Nick's Bargains |
| 3   | Worst Buy       |

| id  | name                        |
| --- | ---                         |
| 1   | Baby Powder                 |
| 2   | Boxing Gloves               |
| 3   | Hulk iPhone Case            |
| 4   | Oversize Novelty Toothbrush |

| product                         | shop                 |
| ---                             | ---                  |
| Baby Powder (1)                 | Nick's Bargains (2)  |
| Baby Powder (1)                 | Worst Buy (3)        |
| Boxing Gloves (2)               | Worst Buy  (3)       |
| Boxing Gloves (2)               | Alex's Boutique (1)  |
| Hulk iPhone Case (3)            | Worst Buy (3)        |
| Oversize Novelty Toothbrush (4) | Alex's Boutique (1)  |
| Oversize Novelty Toothbrush (4) | Nick's Bargains (2)  |
| Oversize Novelty Toothbrush (4) | Worst Buy (3)        |

#### Queries:

Get every product in Nick's Bargains (id = 2)
```
SELECT shop_products.shop_id, products.name
FROM products
INNER JOIN shop_products
ON (shop_products.product_id = products.id)
WHERE shop_products.shop_id = 2;
```
---

Get every shop that carries oversize novelty toothbrushes (id = 4)
```
SELECT shop_products.product_id, shops.name
FROM shops
INNER JOIN shop_products
ON (shop_products.shop_id = shops.id)
WHERE shop_products.product_id = 4;
```


### Many-to-many: Twitter Followers
You have many followers on twitter AND you follow many people.

tables.sql:
```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
);

CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS followers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER,
    follower_user_id INTEGER
);
```
---
Create Users
```
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('brad');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('sarah');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('donald');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('fred');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('ray');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('nick');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('akira');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('albert');
INSERT INTO users (name) VALUES ('charles');
```

Users follow each other
```
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (1,2);
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (1,3);
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (1,4);
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (5,1);
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (6,2);
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (6,5);
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (8,5);
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (7,5);
INSERT INTO followers (user_id, follower_user_id) VALUES (9,5);
```


Get your followers:
```
SELECT followers.follower_user_id
FROM users
INNER JOIN followers
ON (followers.user_id = users.id)
WHERE users.id = 1;
```


Get people you're following:
```
SELECT users.id, users.name
FROM users INNER JOIN followers
ON (followers.user_id = users.id)
WHERE followers.follower_user_id = 1;
```

#### Pairing Exercise

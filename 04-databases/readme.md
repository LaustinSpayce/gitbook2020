# Databases

Now we'll be seeing a complete system for storing data on the disk.

No more reading in a file in order to edit it. No more managing which key is unique- name, id, etc.

The down side is that we are introducing another self-contained complex system.

In order to interact with this system we will need to communicate with it over the network, and send it commands in a special language- SQL.

We will be starting out working with just the database itself, and then we will integrate it into our app.

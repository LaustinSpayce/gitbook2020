## SQL: Structured Query Language

SQL is both a language and a system for storing and retrieving data.


SQL is based on `TABLE`s of information. These are basically spreadsheets.

These tables have individual records inside them called *rows*.

A collection of tables makes a database.


```
 id |     name    |   weight
----+-------------+-----------
 1  | Chee Kean   |   7
 2  | Susan Chan  |   9
 3  | Steven      |   6
 4  | Josh        |   2

```

SQL Language is designed to be able to *query*, or ask for any kind or combination or order of data in a set of tables.

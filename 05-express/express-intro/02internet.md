## HTTP URLs

Let's add the idea that we want to get specific things over the internet. This is essentially what a web app is. It gets information but formatted in a specific way beyond just spitting out static files. In order to take more specific input, we need to specify what we want in a more complex way. The getting and formatting of this data is what this class is all about.

### Naming of Resources/Pages and Categorization of Data

- Each thing we request is a resource
- URLs are a specficication for the location of a resource
- We format the request for the resources in a particular syntax
- We can request web pages through the browser
- We can request JSON through javascript
- (We can request either through either)
- URLs are formatted similarly to file paths
- There is a root path, and then a set of resources
- Each web dev chooses a way to format the order of a URL

#### Elements of a URL

URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator, and it's just a string of text characters used by Web browsers, email clients and other software to format the contents of an internet request message.

Let's breakdown the contents of a URL:

> Note. Draw the following on the board

```
    http://www.example.org/hello/world/foo.html?foo=bar&baz=bat#footer
    \___/  \_____________/ \__________________/ \_____________/ \____/
  protocol  host/domain name        path         querystring     hash/fragment
```


```
    http://www.example.org:3000/hello/world/foo.html?foo=bar&baz=bat#footer
    \__/  \_____________/ \__/\__________________/ \_____________/ \____/
protocol|host/domain name|port|      path         | querystring   | hash/fragment
```

#### protocol
the most popular application protocol used on the world wide web is HTTP. Other familiar types of application protocols include FTP, SSH, GIT, FILE, HTTPS

---

#### host/domain name
the host or domain name is looked up in DNS to find the IP address of the host - the server that's providing the resource. This may include a subdomain, which in it's simplest sense is like a folder on the server. www is actually a subdomain and is often used by default on servers, allowing you to omit it in the URL sometimes.

---

#### path
web servers can organise resources into what is effectively mimicking files in directories; the path indicates to the server which file from which directory the client wants

---

#### querystring
the client can pass parameters to the server through the querystring (in a GET request method); the server can then use these to customise the response - such as values to filter a search result

---

#### hash/fragment
the URI fragment is generally used by the client to identify some portion of the content in the response; interestingly, a broken hash will not break the whole link - it isn't the case for the previous elements

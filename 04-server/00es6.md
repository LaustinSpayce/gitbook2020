# Express ES6 - Solutions to JS Scope

### Context
ES6 gives us more tools to be explicit about variables and control scope.

### Learning Objectives
- know when to use `let`
- know when to use `const`
- know when to use `var`

## ES6 Variable Declaration: Clean Up Sloppy Code Practices

- declare variables in the right place and time
- values of variables don't bleed over into the wrong place
- `var` declaration still works with `looks out but not in`
- `const` and `let` do not
- use these new tools to be more explicit about what your variables are and where they are being used.

# Block level scoping

Q. What is a block?

A. Anything between curly braces.
---

```
while(){
  // yes
}

for(...){
  //yes
}

if(){
  //yes
}

switch(){
  case: //no
  case: //no
}
switch(){
  case: foo{
    //yes
  }
  case: bar{
    //yes
  }
}
```

## What is Let and Const?

---
- LET: allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used.
- CONST: they are not immutable, but the reference to the variable cannot be changed. also allows you to declare the variable within that block scope.

---

E.g. const cannot be reassigned
```js
var hello = 2;
const bye = 10;
for (var i = 0; i < hello; i++) {

  // because of block level scope, this creates a new
  // const, and hence does not come in conflict with the const bye globally

  const bye = 5;
  console.log(bye);
}
console.log(bye);
```

---

E.g. let - only exist in the {} scope
```js
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000)
}

for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000)
}
```

---

For let / const, you can only declare a variable inside of its scope once.
JavaScript
```js
const key = 'abc123';
let points = 50;
let winner = false;
let points = 100;
```
-> The browser says points has already been declared.

---

Now, what if I had this?

JavaScript
```js
const key = 'abc123';
let points = 50;
let winner = false;

if(points > 40) {
   let winner = true
}
```

The important thing here is that these two winner variables are actually two separate variables. They have the same name, but they are both scoped differently:

let winner = false outside of the if loop is scoped to the window.
let winner = true inside the if loop is scoped to the block.

---

## When to use let and const
We are switching to let and const in nodejs.

Don't use var unless you have a specific (scope) reason.
If you want a global variable, just declare it outside of anything.

The general rules are:
- `let` for basic type variables: strings, numbers, booleans, etc.
- `const` for objects and arrays.
- `const` for basic type variables whose value you don't want to change over the course of your program.
- Ex.: `const milesPerKilometer = 1.6;`

# Arrow Functions
ES6 anaonymous functions that have their own scope

Arrow function is a more concise syntax for writing function expressions. They utilize a new token, "=>", that looks like a fat arrow. Arrow functions are anonymous and change the way scope is calculated in JS.

---

#### How do we use it?
```js
// ES5
var multiply = function(x, y) {
  return x * y
};

// Longest syntax:

// Replace the `function` keyword with `=>`, put it on the other side.
// ES6
var multiply = (x, y) => {
  return x * y
};

```
---
```
// Single Line Syntax:
var multiply = (x, y) => { return x * y };

// Concise Syntax: ( only if you have a single parameter )
var multiply = x => { return x * 3 };

// Implicit Return Syntax:
var multiply = x => x * 3;

// Implicit Return Syntax w/o curly braces, zero parameters:
var multiply = () => 5 * 3;

// anonymous functions
setTimeout( function(){
  console.log("hello");
}, 1000 );

setTimeout( () => { console.log("hello"); }, 1000 );
setTimeout( () => console.log("hello"), 1000 );
```

---

### Review: our JS scope problems in the browser:

---

####Basic block scope

Now, Javascript looks out **if you want it to**, but not in.

#### Still basic block scope + async timing

People commonly make this error:

```
for (var i=0; i<5; i++) {

  var link = document.createElement("a");

  link.innerHTML = "Link " + i;

  link.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert(i);
  });

  document.body.appendChild(link);
}

```
---

```

// or a while loop if we want to be specific about the exact scope context:
var i = 0;

while( i < 5 ){

  var link = document.createElement("a");

  link.innerHTML = "Link " + i;

  link.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert(i);
  });

  document.body.appendChild(link);

  i++;
}
```

The value of `i` is not held inside the event listener function.

---

### solutions

---

#### Use let
```
for (let i=0; i<5; i++) {

  var link = document.createElement("a");

  link.innerHTML = "Link " + i;

  link.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert(i);
  });

  document.body.appendChild(link);
}
```

---

```
// while example
var i = 0;

while( i < 5 ){

  let j = i;

  var link = document.createElement("a");

  link.innerHTML = "Link " + j;

  link.addEventListener('click', function() {
    alert(j);
  });

  document.body.appendChild(link);

  i++;
}

```

### Let / Const Pairing Exercise
- create a new index.js file
- copy and paste the code into the file by section
- get rid of the errors for each section
- `console.log` each variable value

---

```
let monkey = 6;
if( true == true ){
  console.log( "monkey is:"+monkey );
}
// NOTE: Constants can be declared with uppercase or lowercase, but a common
// convention is to use all-uppercase letters.

```
```
// define MY_FAV as a constant and give it the value 7
const MY_FAV = 7;

// this will throw an error - Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
MY_FAV = 20;

// MY_FAV is 7

```
```
// trying to redeclare a constant throws an error -  Uncaught SyntaxError: Identifier 'MY_FAV' has already been declared
const MY_FAV = 20;
```
```

// the name MY_FAV is reserved for constant above, so this will fail too
var MY_FAV = 20;
```
```

// this throws an error too
let MY_FAV = 20;
```

```
// it's important to note the nature of block scoping
if (MY_FAV === 7) {
    // this is fine and creates a block scoped MY_FAV variable
    // (works equally well with let to declare a block scoped non const variable)
    let MY_FAV = 20;

    // MY_FAV is now 20

    // this gets hoisted into the global context and throws an error
    var MY_FAV = 20;
}
```

```
// MY_FAV is still 7

// throws an error - Uncaught SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration
const FOO;

```
```
// const also works on objects
const MY_OBJECT = {'key': 'value'};

// Attempting to overwrite the object throws an error - Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
MY_OBJECT = {'OTHER_KEY': 'value'};
```
```

// However, object keys are not protected,
// so the following statement is executed without problem
MY_OBJECT.key = 'otherValue';

```
```
// The same applies to arrays
const MY_ARRAY = [];
// It's possible to push items into the array
MY_ARRAY.push('A'); // ["A"]
```
```
// However, assigning a new array to the variable throws an error - Uncaught TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.
MY_ARRAY = ['B'];

```
```
// change this to hold the value of i
for (var i = 1; i <= 5; i++){
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, 1000)
}
```

### Arrow Function Pairing Exercise
- use the same index.js file as above
- copy and paste all of the code into the file
- execute all the functions and `console.log` each value
- **do not** write the console.log in the function. Capture the output in a variable and console.log that.

```js
// ES5
var multiply = function(x, y) {
  return x * y
};

// Longest syntax:

// Replace the `function` keyword with `=>`, put it on the other side.
// ES6
var multiply = (x, y) => {
  return x * y
};

// Single Line Syntax:
var multiply = (x, y) => { return x * y };

// Concise Syntax: ( only if you have a single parameter )
var multiply = x => { return x * 3 };

// Implicit Return Syntax w/o parentheses:
var multiply = x => x * 3;

// Implicit Return Syntax w/o curly braces, zero parameters:
var multiply = () => 5 * 3;

// anonymous functions
setTimeout( function(){
  console.log("hello");
}, 1000 );

setTimeout( () => { console.log("hello"); }, 1000 );
setTimeout( () => console.log("hello"), 1000 );
```

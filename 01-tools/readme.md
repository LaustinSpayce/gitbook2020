# Tools

Programming requires the setup of many different kinds of development tools.

We'll be learning a bit about some of the tools you'll use in your daily workflow.

Just like any crafts-person, knowing your tools well is the mark of a dedicated and efficient developer.

Take the time to investigate the shortcuts and small things that make using your coding environment easy and friction-free. (i.e., learn to use command-save shortcut key instead of clicking menu -> file -> save)

Keep your coding and learning enviorment clean and organized:

- Name and keep an efficent folder structure that works for you.
- Keep the number of open browser, terminal and editor tabs relatively small and managable.
- Always keep those browser, terminal and editor tabs in the same spacial location on your screen.
- Take and keep notes in a place that is easy to organize and re-read.

# React Hot Loader

Nodemon for the front-end


### Getting started
We will implement the webpack sass asset pipeline for the jsx code, with the same reload functionality we get with nodemon.

Use this branch: [https://github.com/wdi-sg/react-reference/tree/3-react-hotload](https://github.com/wdi-sg/react-reference/tree/3-react-hotload)

Look at what we added: [https://github.com/wdi-sg/react-reference/compare/2-react-jsx-intro..3-react-hotload](https://github.com/wdi-sg/react-reference/compare/2-react-jsx-intro..3-react-hotload)

- react hot loader
- index.html that gets built by react
- production build script

### Building index.jsx

Run the example app: `npm run dev` `node index.js`

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Open the generated `main.js` file. Scroll to the bottom. What do you see?

Make a change in your jsx code and see it change in the browser instantly.

### Production

Build the production files. `npm run build`

Run the server. `npm run start` Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Open the generated `main.js` file.

### Pairing Exercise

Clone the react repo into a named folder:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/wdi-sg/react-reference.git hotloading-react
```

Check out the hot laoding branch:

```bash
$ git checkout 3-react-hotload
```

Repeat the above.

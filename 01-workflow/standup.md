# Standup

Every morning we'll cluster together into small groups of four or five - _scrums work best with small numbers of people_.

Each person in a group will use a marker to put on the wall:

1. what they achieved yesterday after class
2. anything they found particularly challenging
3. draw how they are feeling this morning
4. (optional) anything useful they discovered which might help others



Then use the rest of the time to discuss what you wrote in your groups.

The point of our scrums, is not to discuss these issues but to simply flag them and create prompts for conversations later during the labs and breaks.

# Agile Development Process

### Objectives

* explain why you need to structure your ideation and feature execution

* explain why you need to structure your workflow in order to achieve your goals

* break down steps in an agile workflow
    * requirements
    * wireframes
    * prioritized features
    * code
    * reevaluate
    * repeat

## Agile and Waterfall

#### Waterfall

_The waterfall model is a sequential design process, used in software development processes, in which progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of Conception, Initiation, Analysis, Design, Construction, Testing, Production/Implementation and Maintenance._- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model)

Waterfall is a good example of a linear methodology. It has it's own benefits:

* simple, easy to understand and use.
* easy to manage due to the rigidity of the model -- each phase has specific deliverables and a review process
* phases are processed, completed one at a time, and do not overlap
* works well for smaller projects where requirements are very well understood

However, other methodologies have evolved as the need for greater flexibility has arisen.

### Agile

_Agile software development is a group of software development methods in which requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. It promotes adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, continuous improvement, and encourages rapid and flexible response to change_- [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development)

### Agile Process at the Beginning of a Project / Beginning of a Feature

#### Begin with the base project statement
- What will your project do? Why?

#### Break down product into "features" by thinking about user actions within the overall product

#### What is the "Minimun Viable Product" needed to fulfill the original statement?

#### Create stories for each feature
- Each story should describe the action being done, and the motivation for an action
_As a **[role]**, I want to **[goal]** so I can **[benefit/purpose]**_

#### Wireframe the interface needed to complete the user actions.

_A website wireframe, also known as a **page schematic** or **screen blueprint**, is a visual guide that represents the **skeletal framework** of a **website**._ - Wikipedia

**Wireframes** are created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose. The purpose is usually being informed by a business objective or a creative idea.

The wireframe depicts the **page layout** or **arrangement** of the website's **content**, including **interface elements** and **navigational systems**, and how they work together.

The wireframe usually lacks typographic style, color, or graphics, since the main focus lies in **functionality**, behavior, and priority of content.

The key points to get across when creating a wireframe are:

* Information design
* Navigation design
* Interface design

#### An example of a wireframe

Let's look at the difference between YouTube's page for a particular video and how a wireframe compares:

Wireframes focus on:

* The range of functions available
* The relative priorities of the information and functions
* The rules for displaying certain kinds of information
* The effect of different scenarios on the display


#### Wireframe and User Story to low-level pseudocode

- _As a user, I want to read reviews of a selected book to help me decide whether to buy **_
- Create wireframe that represents this functionality
- Think of the actual first user action that you will need to write code for
- Write some pseudocode that represents the action

#### Code Design Review
What rules can we give ourselves about the format of code?

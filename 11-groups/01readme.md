# Collaboration With Github Workflow

> From [Github Guides](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)

We're going to have an entire class on team workflows with Git and GitHub before Project 3 (the group project). But we want to take a few minutes to get started thinking about working in groups with Git by talking about the GitHub workflow:



![Github Workflows](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wdi-sg/gitbook-2019/master/images/github_workflows.jpg)


#### Create an Issue

An Issue is a note on a repo regarding some matter that needs attention. It could be a bug, a suggestion for a new feature, a question about the repo or code, etc! On GitHub you can also label, search and assign issues, which help with managing projects.

It can be useful to write the issue as short functional spec.

#### Create a Branch

Create a feature branch off of master to work on this issue. The branch name should reflect the issue or feature we are working on.

```bash
 $ git checkout -b <feature_branch_name>
```

> Example of good branch names: `fix-login-authentication`, `animate-nav-bar`

#### Work on your Branch and Commit Locally

Make changes, stage, and commit locally, then push your branch up to the remote repository.

```bash
 $ git add <file-path>
```

```bash
 $ git commit -m "message"
```

```bash
 $ git push <remote_name> <feature_branch_name>
```

> Example: `$ git push origin fix-login-authentication`

#### Open a Pull Request (PR)

By making a pull request, youâ€™re requesting that someone pull in your changes (commits) and merge them into the branch you are making the pull request against (probably `master`). A PR allows you to compare the contents of two branches, and all the changes (the diff) are highlighted in green and red.

As soon as you commit and push a change, you can open a Pull Request. People use Pull Requests as a medium for starting discussion about commits (code review) even before the code is finished. This way you can get feedback as you go or help from other developers/team members! This type of feedback can be extremely potent and productive since your code and its comments will have an evident thought process that will be the basis for targeted feedback on your code.

#### Merge Branch into Master

It's good practice to even make a pull request for branches in your own repository and merge it yourself to get more comfortable with PRs!

#### Merge Master into Branch
If you are working on a branch for a while, while major changes are being made to the code base, it's a good idea to keep your branch "clean" and updated with the latest changes from the `master` branch.

```bash
 $ git checkout my-branch
 $ git merge master
 # fix any merge issues
```

You can merge master **into** your branch in order to keep up to date with changes.

You can also use this technique top fix any merge conflicts that you are aware of, *before* you make your pull request. This way you don't make your teammates responsible for the merge conflicts from your branch.


## Make a PR from a Branch (15 min, 1:30)

Building off the previous exercise, work through the following:

1. Create a remote repository on GitHub for your project. Be sure to checkout the `master` branch when doing your first push!
2. From the `master` branch, create a `contact_page` branch
3. Create a `contact.html` page with the HTML5 boilerplate for a html document and an `<a>` tag with your email address in it
4. Push the `contact_page` branch to your new remote on GitHub
5. From GitHub, make a pull request and merge your `contact_page` branch in to `master`

## Merge Conflicts (15 min, 1:45)

Merging does not always go smoothly, so don't be alarmed! When git tries to automatically merge commit histories,  it sometimes fails due to conflicting changes. This is called a **merge conflict**.

```
Auto-merging <file_name>
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in <file_name>
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

When we try to merge two branches (or commits from the same branch from a remote), changes may conflict. In this case, git will stop and ask us to fix the issues manually.

A "conflict" occurs when the commit that has to be merged has some change in the same place as the current commit.

To resolve a merge conflict:

1. Locate which files contain conflicts using `git status`
2. Open those files and fix the conflicts. (Look for the '<<<<', '====', and '>>>>' which will guide you to the conflict)
3. Commit the fixes.

```
<<<<<<< HEAD:file.txt
This is the original text in your current branch
=======
This is the modified text
>>>>>>> 77976da35a11db4580b80ae27e8d65caf5208086:file.txt
```

> The HEAD is a reference to the last commit in your current checked out branch. Anything between <<<<< HEAD and ===== is the original code from your checked out branch, while anything beneath from ===== to >>>>>> are the changes introduced by the commit you are trying to merge



## Inducing a Merge Conflict

#### Make Changes to the Home Page

1. Checkout the `new-story` branch from the previous exercise
2. Modify the file by changing text in the first line.
3. Stage and commit your changes to the `new-story` branch
4. Push your changes to the remote repository (`origin new-story`)



### Make the Exact Same Changes to the Master Branch

1. Checkout the `master` branch
2. Modify the `index.html` file by making the exact same changes to the `<h1>` element and adding a `<p>` element below it, just like you did on the `home_page` branch in Step 2.

> The idea is to each make changes to the ***same thing***--a merge conflict will occur once the second set of conflicting changes are pushed

2. Stage and Commit your changes on the `master` branch
3. Push your changes to the remote repository (`origin master`)


From GitHub try to make a pull request and merge your changes!

### You Do: Conflict Exercise (15 min, 0:55)
[https://github.com/wdi-sg/merge-conflicts](https://github.com/wdi-sg/merge-conflicts)


## You Do: Start a Git Cheat Sheet (20 min, 2:25)

Divide up in to groups of 3 or 4 for this activitiy. Your mission is to create a repository with a set of cheat sheets for common git commands and workflows. Divide up the work up amongst yourselves but you should all contribute to the same repository!

This exercise is an opportunity for you to practice following good Git practices like committing often and pushing to a remote. It is also an opportunity for you to practice working with Git in a team.

Your cheat sheet needs to include the following:

- Readme
  - Description of the cheat sheet
  - List of links to the other markdown files
  - List of collaborators (everyone in your group with links to their GitHub)
- Basics
  - creating a new repository
  - "saving" your work by staging and committing
  - cloning
- Branching
  - creating branches
  - deleting branches
  - merging branches
- Remotes
  - adding a remote
  - removing a remote
  - renaming a remote

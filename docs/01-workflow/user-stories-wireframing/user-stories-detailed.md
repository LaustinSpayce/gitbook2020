# User Stories

Now that we have gathered the general requirements of the app and what purpose it fullfills for the user, we will be learning how to construct a set of user action pathways for the user to take.

These are called user stories.

We will then take these user stories and break them down into individual actions that the user will do to accomplish that one pathway.

From there we can begin writing code that implements these tasks.
